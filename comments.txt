My favourite food is anything I didn't have to cook myself.
Now if he does off himself, everyone will think hes having a laugh screwing with people instead of actually dead

Yes I heard abt the f bombs! That has to be why. Thanks for your reply:) until then hubby and I will anxiously wait ??
We need more boards and to create a bit more space for [NAME]. Then we’ll be good.
Damn youtube and outrage drama is super lucrative for reddit
It might be linked to the trust factor of your friend.
Demographics? I don’t know anybody under 35 who has cable tv.
Aww... she'll probably come around eventually, I'm sure she was just jealous of [NAME]... I mean, what woman wouldn't be! lol
Hello everyone. Im from Toronto as well. Can call and visit in personal if needed.
R/sleeptrain Might be time for some sleep training. Take a look and try to feel out what's right for your family.
[NAME] - same fucking problem, slightly better command of the English language.
Shit, I guess I accidentally bought a Pay-Per-View boxing match
Thank you friend
Fucking coward.
that is what retardation looks like
Maybe that’s what happened to the great white at Houston zoo
I never thought it was at the same moment, but sometimes after [NAME] sacrifice... sounds logical
i got a bump and a bald spot. i feel dumb <3
You are going to do the dishes now
Slowing things down now
His name has already been released. Just can't post it here.
Stupidly stubborn / stubbornly stupid
Mine was apparently [NAME] and the giant peach!
I miss them being alive
Super, thanks
A new study just came out from China that it's actually too late.
Troll, bro. They know they're saying stupid shit. The motherfucker does nothing but stink up libertarian subs talking shit
All sounds possible except the key, I can't see how it was missed in the first search.
Your aunt has some damn nerve, though!
Ok, then what the actual fuck is your plan?
What does FPTP have to do with the referendum?
Happy to be able to help.
18 is hot but very bland, it's just here this blonde lady who is not as hot as blonde launch.
Famous for his 3-4 Defense
Pretty sure I’ve seen this. He swings away with the harness he is wearing. Still looks painful but I think he lives
When I feel down I listen to music.
aw, thanks! I appreciate that!
Thanks! I love watching him every week
I read on a different post that he died shortly after of internal injuries.
Honestly it sounds exhausting being married to him. Maybe it will be better for you in the long run.
It's crazy how far Photoshop has come. Underwater bridges?!! NEVER!!!
I wouldn't let a sweet potato dictate decisions, ever.
It's true though. He either gets no shirt and freezes to death or wears a stupid looking butchers cape. I hope he gets something better next season
It's a better option because it's my life and none of your business? Lmfao, who are you
Sack, shaft, and tip. The trifecta.
I know. My question was if they **used** to compete in T5-TTT2.
FBI!! OPEN UP!!!
Should’ve dumped coke all over her right after the movie, and make a run for it. Fk pettiness
You can always kneel.
Cheers, sololander!
Very interesting. Thx
This isn't really wholesome
your mom likes to copy me cause she has no creativity just like you:
Lord help me I want to be a mod again. So many damn trolls here
Oh holy heck :/
Thanks DB, I'll see if I can find the book
LOL. Super cute!
I just shit my pants. Then walk away. Embarrassing enough he won't press or follow you.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN [NAME]?
This...has 9k upvotes. Wow.
[NAME] sees all
Awesome. Thanks!
Wait. What. How?
And then they say, “HAHAHAHHA IT WAS RIGHT THERE WOW!”
Aww, try mindfulness. I think I am going over to that sub now.
Twilight... STILL a better love story than The Last Jedi!
Detective from svu.
Good for #70 to console the poor guy
The republicans are the military. You are an idiot.
Don't kiss your doorbell! Or anyone else's for that matter...
Just got home from school. How are we doing
This pic they used for [NAME] makes her look like [NAME]
Awesome! I’m a cradle [RELIGION], so really interesting to hear your experience. Thanks for sharing.
What a wonderful world
Never get out of the boat.
just noticed, lol. damn pervert foreigners.
Oh forgive us for trying to make an exciting atmosphere at our homecourt.
true I am a troll, but fortunately for me I'm not emotionally invested in it.
sorry [NAME]! ??????
At least it’s not anything worse, and that you are still close to that person :)
This is the first person Australia has tried to do this to...
my brain hurts...
Thank you for at least doing something good sir.
He was off by 5 minutes, not impressed.
Sometimes life actually hands you lemons. We're just lucky that we have a proverbial phrase that gives us an idea of what we can do with them.
People on the other side want you dead no matter why you are there.
Pay you for what, just standing there? Done.
Cleavage: Nature's Brass Catcher.
Apologies, I take it all back as I’ve just seen his latest effort
I love Rocket Love and Blasted. I just wonder who the songs were written for because these are all reference tracks except Acura Intergul
okay im interested in joining the bare hands hunting posse
Damn for that much you may as well use a mobile plan unless you're doing something latency sensitive.
I think the 90 day rule applies to increases over 5%?
If they bolt its a feature.
So this means the people who have debt can see those that don’t. Am I sensing an easier target for muggings and such?
Skynet has really lost its edge
You just make her sound awesome.
seriously wtf. I want to see how the whole hand went in detail. that was the sickest soulread ever
Your team lacks ethics.
[NAME] was useless, aside from bandaging [NAME] up a bit more than she already did and treating [NAME], name one decision [NAME] has made smartly.
Not the **emotional effect**, when it's in the best interest of our country.
i wouldn't take that significant of a pay cut. you should keep your job and do your creative writing on the side/free time.
Hey, I just shared the tweet with the quote. I don't know about all that
Who is this Wild team? Where have they been?
omg [NAME] and his dad walking out together is so cute ??
Thanks I'll give it a go. Nothing used for randoms at all? Would it be better for me to find a group to play with?
Why’s he pointless? I want to know how people like you watch this game. Genuinely baffles me.
I appreciate his deadpan humour.
So I said earlier that this team was boring without [NAME] lately. I take that back after the last two games.
I was kicked, and apparently don't care about oversharing on Reddit about it anymore
It's because you play against 1000 ms ping EU players that have no idea what's going on. Happy hunting!
Updooted like the filthy animal I am.
The fuck is “mog?!”
Especially that “Australia ain’t gonna cop it” ad on TV god I hate [NAME]
And you believe this?
If you are into sours they put out some decent stuff, but anything outside of that is completely forgettable and average.
We thought he was getting better but then he turned himself around.
You seem slightly sensitive... I was actually thinking we had been infiltrated by the normies
Yet another clown whining about discussions about bitcoin in a bitcoin sub.
"Three words, no subtlety. ""Dude. Stop. Seriously."""
"[NAME] dude I see [NAME] so rarely that I forget that he's the OG ""Fuck this character fuck this stupid game"" king."
Wow. I just read the synopsis, and that’s really what happens.
Wow, that landlady sure is a piece of shit. I'd be interested in knowing how many people she has discriminated against or harassed in the past.
I KILL YOU SCUM
It’s way too broken, anyone and their dog can use it.
Tournament was a blast met some really cool people loved it all. Thanks for holding it. Would love to do it again someday
Yeah, I am! I'll private message you a link to my profile. Thank you.
*curb your enthusiasm theme intensifies*
youre a disgusting piece of filth.
By the way the dogs also alerted at kuss road but will just ignore that much like [NAME] did lol ciao
This is sort of wholesome in a weird way
Just an employee, just stressed that it takes so long to save 10k for example and even that is nothing ! Should of brought more bitcoins
Kinda. And thank you. I'm curious about those files and film and fotos you mentioned.
I don't think aspergers causes me distress or anxiety. I think having to live in a society that privileges neurotypical modes of interaction causes me distress and anxiety
Looks like my greyhounds feet
You told me it was pointless to point it out. You're the idiot
2019 should just be a picture of a trash can or dumpster on fire. Amazing how shitty DICE can make things in 10 years.
Yeah let's wrap up AS4 I'm suddenly so much more excited for S11
He left the bench and is back in the locker room with the medical staff
Deluxe always need ingest people, there's also fairly regular openings for media operators.
Absolutely. I'd love it. No matter how much I like the guy, if he just goes for it that's not cool.
Honestly, same. I was miserable at my admin asst job.
Glad to see Hearts fans giving [NAME] such a warm welcome back..
Glad you feel better! My offer still stands though, if you need someone, I’m here
Colts Offense is laughable right now
Lol so petty, I kinda love it. I probably wouldn’t actually do that but it’s tempting.
Lmao Stole my joke! ??
Welcome to the party pal!
Is this a [NAME] reference. I feel like it is.
Don't think we should be stomping all over people's bodily autonomy just so public health authorities can declare victory.
Can he teach them to run really really fast?
Please enlighten us, O oracle. This should be rich...
[NAME] was one of the only good things in that season
Your coaching is terrible.... be ready and see how [NAME] uses [NAME]
I adore this comment section <3
How did you try it if it's not live yet? There was no early access to it
You got it, thanks!
No deagle nerf/vault, good patch but could be way better
Stop master debating, you are making a fool out of yourself. It's concerning.
I think it depends on how many people are awake and passing by at the time of the posting.
as long as the tracking shows delivered, it's not your responsibility what happens to it after that
[NAME] got in before [NAME], but other than that...
My stylist is a fit, handsome guy with big, sexy hands. Can't say I don't like it when he tousles my hair.
You are giving them human emotions. If you spent any time with cattle at all you would realize how silly that is.
"He may have, I was more worried about the ""running and shooting the AR one handed, off to the side""."
Hmmm, can I see that statistic claiming Rowan engineering is that high?
horse meat is fucking peng i love it. why is it ok for a cow to be slaughtered for food but not a horse? ridiculous double standards
Where’s Sharpton now?
good luck buddy
it really do be like that sometimes
Define woman please if you're not going to use the accepted denotation.
Your response is truly one of the most amazing ones I’ve seen.
That’s a straight up ghoul
I don’t understand why people give gold to crossposts. You deserve all the upvotes.
No problem at all, glad I could help :) Cheers!
We're not moving.
My [NAME]! This isnt a vaccine! It's a jello shot!
Who do you think can lead the Packers to where they need to be?
Thanks, :), as the days go by they are getting better.
Oh wow. Yeah I’m very new, only about 8 hours gameplay
"*""Success is the best revenge.""* Good job OP. Stay strong. You're almost there."
Food stamps are a disgrace. People should get money!
Whisper me your steam id but it'll be 1-2 hours until I can start playing
By [NAME]! That’s [NAME] music!
You just needed a [RELIGION] grandparent to be killed
You live in Appalachia, don’t you?
That pole and cheap plastic fence surely would offer excellent protection from a car. Walk it off brah.
What the fuck is [NAME] doing in the background
It creates perverse incentives. Allow underpaid prison labour and suddenly you've an incentive towards exploiting your prison population rather than rehabilitating them.
Yeahhhh no, you're banned for this whole convo.
I always just say “thank you” because it’s a nice thought ?????
To be fair, [NAME] is an amazing broadcaster.
I had 3 last night ?? this rant was after glass #1
Dv cus it’s playful doggos
I'm 14 stone...so probably about 2 stone over weight. I don't drink alcohol or do drugs, but I love food....
